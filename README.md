### Gameplay
We control the mole by `arrows` and `space`.

Mole is digging tunnels buring the ground around. It must eat worms not to die from `Hunger` as well as keeping access to the air so as not to `Suffocate`.

The `Lawn Owner` tries to kill our mole in many ways. For a now the main target is to survive satisfactorily long.

We can also collect `Moss` to make nest in the tunnel which will not be buried with dirt.

### Running
Cloned repository requires gradlew. We simply build with `./gradlew build` and run with `./gradlew run`. Those commands are also in `build.sh` and `run.sh`
